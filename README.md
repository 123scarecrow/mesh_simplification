# mesh_simplification

Implementation of a surface simplification algorithm, that can rapidly produce high quality
approximations of polygonal models. The algorithm uses iterative contractions of vertex
pairs to simplify models and maintains surface error approximations using quadric matrices.

Based on the paper by Michael Garland & Paul S. Heckbert:
